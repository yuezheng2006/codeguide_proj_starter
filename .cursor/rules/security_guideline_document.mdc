# Implementation Plan Overview

Based on your summary, we can break down the project into several key components. Each component can be built with our security-first approach in mind, ensuring that we address concerns such as secure API integration, robust session management, error handling, and a clean, minimalist UI. Below is an overview of the major areas we can focus on:

## 1. API Integration
- **External AI APIs (Replicate, Fal):**
  - Authentication and secure API key management
  - Request formatting and parameter handling
  - Error handling and rate limit management
  - Logging and monitoring of API calls
- **Future Integration with OpenAI:**
  - Scalable design to accommodate additional API calls

## 2. Frontend Development
- **Framework & Tools:** Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Typescript, Shadcn UI
  - Responsive and minimalist design
  - Dynamic parameter display based on the selected AI model
  - Real-time feedback (progress indicators, error pop-ups)
- **Social Sharing:**
  - Integration with social platforms, ensuring secure sharing practices (e.g., safe redirection, OAuth where applicable)

## 3. Backend & Session Management
- **Supabase Usage:**
  - Session-based history management for generated images
  - Serverless function implementations to handle interactions with external APIs
- **Session Persistence:**
  - Handling sessions via secure cookies or local storage with a focus on security (e.g., secure attributes, proper expiry)

## 4. Error Handling & Monitoring
- **Robust Error Handling:**
  - User-friendly error pop-ups with clear instructions
  - Logging mechanisms for back-end errors to monitor and trigger alerts
  - Potential retry mechanisms for handling transient API failures

## 5. Security Considerations
- **HTTPS Enforcement and Secure Communications**
- **Data Handling:**
  - Secure management of credentials and sensitive session data
  - Implementation of security headers (e.g., Content-Security-Policy, Strict-Transport-Security)
- **Defensive Coding:**
  - Input validation and output encoding on both frontend and backend
  - Regular vulnerability scans for dependencies

## 6. Testing & Deployment
- **Cross-Browser and Device Testing:**
  - Ensure consistent behavior across various platforms
- **Deployment Setup:**
  - Vercel or a similar hosting provider with secure configurations and controlled access
  
## Next Steps
I can help break down any of these areas step-by-step. 

**Which component would you like to focus on first?**

Possible starting points include:
- Detailed API integration strategy (handling external AI APIs)
- Frontend UI development and secure session management
- Error handling and security setup
- Backend development with Supabase integration
